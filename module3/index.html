Wikipedia began as a complementary project for Nupedia, a free online English-language encyclopedia project whose articles were written by experts and reviewed under a formal process. Nupedia was founded on March 9, 2000, under the ownership of Bomis, a web portal company. Its main figures were the Bomis CEO Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, editor-in-chief for Nupedia and later Wikipedia. Nupedia was licensed initially under its own Nupedia Open Content License, switching to the GNU Free Documentation License before Wikipedia's founding at the urging of Richard Stallman.[18] Sanger and Wales founded Wikipedia.[19][20] While Wales is credited with defining the goal of making a publicly editable encyclopedia,[21][22] Sanger is credited with the strategy of using a wiki to reach that goal.[23] On January 10, 2001, Sanger proposed on the Nupedia mailing list to create a wiki as a "feeder" project for Nupedia.[24]

Wikipedia was formally launched on January 15, 2001, as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[25] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[21] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[26] was codified in its first months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[21] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[27]

Wikipedia gained early contributors from Nupedia, Slashdot postings, and web search engine indexing. By August 8, 2001, Wikipedia had over 8,000 articles.[28] On September 25, 2001, Wikipedia had over 13,000 articles.[29] By the end of 2001 it had grown to approximately 20,000 articles and 18 language editions. It had reached 26 language editions by late 2002, 46 by the end of 2003, and 161 by the final days of 2004.[30] Nupedia and Wikipedia coexisted until the former's servers were taken down permanently in 2003, and its text was incorporated into Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia passed the mark of two million articles on September 9, 2007, making it the largest encyclopedia ever assembled, surpassing even the 1408 Yongle Encyclopedia, which had held the record for almost 600 years.[31]

Citing fears of commercial advertising and lack of control in Wikipedia, users of the Spanish Wikipedia forked from Wikipedia to create the Enciclopedia Libre in February 2002.[32] These moves encouraged Wales to announce that Wikipedia would not display advertisements, and to change Wikipedia's domain from wikipedia.com to wikipedia.org.[33]</p></section>
