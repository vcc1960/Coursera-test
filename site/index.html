<p>I got my first camera when I was 10 years old. My mother did not like the cost of printing photos, thus would grawl at me. I wish I grew up with digital photography. </p>

<p>I spent a summer at NESOP (New England School of Photography) in Boston and then did two independent studies at Connecticut College, in New London. I spent hours developing negatives, checking contact sheets and printing. I loved the photo enravelling just in front of me. </p>

My interests in photography have covered the very small electron microscopy to what is observable with our naked eyes.

<p>I have been mesmerized by Nature perhaps because I grew up in Africa or because of my training in biology. But beauty and the unbelievable structures and functions in nature are simply splendid. </p>

<p> Anthropology opened my eyes to Humans in their environments and their interactions with the group and nature.  </p>

<p> Nature and Humans have been at the center of every photo I have take. Some are more conceptual than others but all captured a moment. </p>
