<p>I got my first camera when I was 10 years old. My mother did not like the cost of printing photos, she would grawl. </p><p>I wish I grew up with digital photography. </p>

<p>I spent a summer at NESOP (New England School of Photography) in Boston and then did two independent studies at Connecticut College, in New London under: prof. Theodore Hendrickson. I absolutely loved our criticism sessions and hearing how people perceived and responded to my work, and most importantly seeing their works. </p>
<p>I spent hours developing negatives, checking contact sheets and printing. <p/>
<p>I loved the photo enravelling just in front of me. </p>

My interests in photography have covered the very small from electron microscopy to what is observable with our naked eyes, to macro photography. All have persisted to suck me into what is aesthetically and soul searching.

<p>I have been mesmerized by Nature because of my training in biology and growing up in Africa. But beauty and the unbelievable structures, and functions in/of nature are simply splendid. </p>

<p> Anthropology opened my eyes to Humans' organization: socioeconomic structure and situation, and their environments.  And prof.McClean</p>

<p> Nature and Humans have been at the center of every photo I have taken. Some are more conceptual than others but all captured a moment. </p>
